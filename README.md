Sorting Algorithms
Sorting algorithms are a fundamental part of computer science. They allow data to be organized in an ordered fashion and can be applied to many different problems. There are many different sorting algorithms, each with their own pros and cons. Some of the most popular sorting algorithms are selection sort, insertion sort, bubble sort, merge sort, quick sort, and heap sort.

Selection sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly finds the smallest element from the unsorted list and puts it at the beginning of the list. This algorithm has an average and worst case time complexity of O(n2).

Insertion sort is another simple sorting algorithm that works by comparing the current item with the items before it and inserting it into the correct position. This algorithm has an average and worst case time complexity of O(n2).

Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. This algorithm has an average and worst case time complexity of O(n2).

Merge sort is a divide and conquer type sorting algorithm that divides the list into two halves, sorts them recursively, and then merges them back together. This algorithm has an average and worst case time complexity of O(n log n).

Quick sort is a divide and conquer type sorting algorithm that works by partitioning the list around a pivot element and recursively sorting the sublists. This algorithm has an average time complexity of O(n log n) and a worst case time complexity of O(n2).

Heap sort is a comparison based sorting algorithm that works by creating a heap out of the list and reordering the list by extracting the minimum element from the heap. This algorithm has an average and worst case time complexity of O(n log n).

Sorting algorithms can be used to solve many different problems, from sorting an array of numbers to sorting a list of words. Choosing the right sorting algorithm for a given problem depends on the size of the data set and the desired time complexity.
